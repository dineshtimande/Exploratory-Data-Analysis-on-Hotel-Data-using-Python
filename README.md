# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Hotel-Data-using-Python

**📌 Project Overview**

This project analyzes a hotel booking dataset containing records from two hotel types — City Hotel and Resort Hotel — spanning three years (2015–2017). The dataset includes detailed information on booking dates, length of stay, cancellations, guest demographics (including children and babies), revenue (adr), special requests, food preferences, and booking channels (agents and distribution platforms). It also provides country-wise booking data, enabling geographic analysis.

The data is segmented by hotel type, allowing for comparative analysis between city and resort hotels. Before visualization, the dataset undergoes thorough data cleaning (handling nulls and duplicates) and data wrangling to prepare it for meaningful insights.

The analysis is conducted both individually for each hotel and comparatively, using charts and dashboards to highlight trends and performance metrics. Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and visualization tools, the project transforms raw booking data into a business-ready intelligence dashboard.


**🎯 Problem Statement**

Hotels face ongoing challenges in maintaining profitability and operational efficiency due to the complex dynamics of:

- Revenue management
- Occupancy optimization
- Booking cancellations
- Guest preference analysis
- Dynamic pricing decisions

High cancellation rates — especially in city hotels — disrupt forecasting and resource planning. Limited understanding of guest behavior restricts upselling and loyalty-building opportunities. Pricing decisions are further complicated by fluctuating demand, reliance on third-party booking platforms, and competitive pressures.

Without a data-driven strategy that integrates booking trends, customer segmentation, and operational metrics, hotels risk:

- Revenue leakage
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Missed opportunities to improve guest satisfaction and brand loyalty
  

**📊 Project Goals**

- Analyze booking behavior and cancellation patterns
- Compare performance between city and resort hotels
- Identify pricing trends and seasonal demand
- Segment guests by demographics and preferences
- Visualize operational metrics for strategic planning


**🧰 Tools & Technologies**

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
